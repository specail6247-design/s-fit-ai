### 💡 Problem & Solution
*Logical, punchy description for the "About" section.*

**The Problem: "The Size Chart Lie"**
Online shopping is broken. We buy three sizes, keep one (maybe), and return the rest. It’s wasteful for the planet and frustrating for us. Size charts are inconsistent, and 2D photos don't tell you how a garment *actually* drapes on your unique body shape.

**The Solution: Precision AI Fitting**
S_FIT AI isn't just a sticker overlay. We use **MediaPipe** to extract 33+ body landmarks from your photo, generating a 3D mannequin that matches your exact proportions. Then, we apply **React Three Fiber** physics to simulate how fabrics from ZARA, Gucci, and Uniqlo behave on *you*. It’s a virtual fitting room that respects your geometry.

**Subject: I built this to stop returning 40% of my clothes.**

Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I’m Jules, the maker behind **S_FIT AI**.

I’ve always loved online shopping, but I hated the "Return Walk of Shame"—lugging boxes back to the post office because the medium was too tight and the large was a tent.

I realized that **Size Charts are broken**. A static table of numbers can’t capture the complexity of the human body.

So, I built S_FIT AI.

**How it works:**
1. Upload a selfie or use your webcam.
2. Our AI (MediaPipe) scans your pose and body shape in seconds.
3. Browse real items from top brands (ZARA, Gucci, etc.).
4. See them on your digital twin in 3D.

We’re starting with a web-based MVP using Next.js 15 and WebGL. I’d love to hear your feedback on the accuracy and what brands you want to see next!

Let’s fix fashion e-commerce together. 🚀

Cheers,
Jules
